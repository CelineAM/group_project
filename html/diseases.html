                    How to choose an effective charity
                    First, plan your research
                    Do you trust someone else? If you know someone who shares your values and has already put a lot of thought into where to
                    give, then consider simply going with their recommendations. You can skip ahead to see some recommendations from experts
                    in charity evaluation. If you still want to do your own research, go to the next step.
                    If you have under $10,000 to give, consider entering a donor lottery. It’s now possible to put $5,000 into a fund with
                    other small donors, in exchange for a 5% chance of being able to choose where $100,000 from that fund gets donated. Why
                    might you want to do this? In the case where you win, you can do a great deal of research into where’s best to give, to
                    allocate that $100,000 as well as possible. Otherwise, you don’t have to do any research, and whoever else wins the
                    lottery does it instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, it’s probably more efficient for small donors to pool their funds, and for one of them to do in-depth
                    research, rather than each of them do a small amount of research. The Centre for Effective Altruism now organises a
                    donor lottery once a year – two of them are open as of this writing in Dec ‘18, and will close on 9 Jan ‘19. You can
                    find out more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re going to do your research, decide how much research to do. The more you’re giving as a percentage of your
                    annual income, the more time it’s worth spending doing research. Roughly speaking, a 1% donation might be worth a few
                    hours’ work, while a 50% donation could be worth a month of research. Another factor is that the more you expect your
                    mind to change, the more research it’s worth doing. If you’re giving 10% and don’t imagine a few days of research would
                    change your mind about which option is best, you should probably just give there. Otherwise, continue to the next step.
